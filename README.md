# EECS6446 Project

Welcome to `EECS6446` autoscaling project. In this project you will deploy a sample
microservice-based application on a `Kubernetes` cluster dedicated to you and create
autoscaling strategies to handle changes in load applied to the cluster.

You can watch a walk-through of the project setup on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/DKAhQk7W1Rw).
There are several references in each part of the tutorial which can help you gain a deeper
understanding of the elements used in that step.
