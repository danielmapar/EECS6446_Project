# EECS6446: Performance Modelling of Computing Systems
## Project - Phase 1

Welcome to `EECS6446` course project. In the first phase of this project, you will deploy a sample
application based on microservice architecture on a `Kubernetes` cluster. Then you exercise various
autoscaling strategies to handle/investigate flactuations in the applied workload to your cluster.

In fact, the first phase of the project is like a tutorial that you need to follow the steps mentioned in 
the below table. We also provided a complete walk-through of all steps here: [Phase 1 Tutorial](https://youtu.be/DKAhQk7W1Rw).

There are several references in each part of the tutorial to help you gain a deeper
understanding of the elements and concepts in each part.

Here is the table of contents for phase 1:
